%The locally convex topology defined
%by $\mathcal{P}$ on $X$ is called the weak topology or $Y-topology$ of X induced by the duality
%$(X,Y)$, and we denote it by $\sigma(X,Y)$. Similarly, the weak topology or X-topology
%of Y, denoted by $\sigma(Y, X)$, is the locally convex topology on Y generated by $Q$.
%Clearly, the roles of $X$ and $Y$ are interchangeable here, since there is a natural duality between $Y$ and $X$ which determines a dual system $(Y,X)$. Thus, it is sufficient to
%establish the properties only for the linear space $X$. According to the well-known re-sults concerning the locally convex topologies generated by families of seminorms,
%we immediately obtain the following result.
