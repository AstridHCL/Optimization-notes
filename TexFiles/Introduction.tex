\begin{lemma}
	Let $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a bounded sequence in a Hilbert Space $H$. Then $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ possesses a weakly convergent subsequence.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
Let $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence in a Hilbert Space $H$. Then $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ converges if and only if it is bounded and possesses at most one weak sequential cluster point.
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem} 
	Let $f: H \rightarrow (âˆ’\infty, \infty]$ be a convex functional on a Hilbert space. Then the following are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman{*})]
\item 	$f$ is weakly sequentially lower semicontinuous.
\item 	$f$ is sequentially lower semicontinuous.
\item 	$f$ is lower semicontinuous.
\item 	$f$ is weakly lower semicontinuous.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{lemma}
	A convex set is closed if and only if it is weakly closed.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
	Every bounded linear operator over a Banach Space is weakly continuos.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[Parallelogram law]
	
\[
\norm{x+y}^2 +\norm{x-y}^2 = 2\norm{x}^2+2\norm{y}^2
\]
