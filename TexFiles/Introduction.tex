\begin{definition}
	We say a functional $J$ is proper if $\dom J \neq \emptyset$ and $J>-\infty$.

\subsection{Useful lemmas and Theorems.}
\begin{lemma}
	Let $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a bounded sequence in a Hilbert Space $H$. Then $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ possesses a weakly convergent subsequence.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
Let $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence in a Hilbert Space $H$. Then $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ converges if and only if it is bounded and possesses at most one weak sequential cluster point.
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem} 
	Let $f: H \rightarrow (âˆ’\infty, \infty]$ be a convex functional on a Hilbert space. Then the following are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman{*})]
\item 	$f$ is weakly sequentially lower semicontinuous.
\item 	$f$ is sequentially lower semicontinuous.
\item 	$f$ is lower semicontinuous.
\item 	$f$ is weakly lower semicontinuous.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{lemma}
	A convex set is closed if and only if it is weakly closed.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
	Every bounded linear operator over a Banach Space is weakly continuos.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[Parallelogram law]
	
\[
\norm{x+y}^2 +\norm{x-y}^2 = 2\norm{x}^2+2\norm{y}^2
\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
	Let $\mathcal{X}$ be a Hausdorff space and let $(f_i)_{i \in I}$ be a family of lower semicontinuous functions from $\mathcal{X}$ to $[-\infty, \infty]$. Then $\sup_{i\in I}f_i$ is lower semi-continuous. If $I$ is finite, then $\min_{i\in I}f_i$ is lower-semicontinuous.
\end{lemma}
\begin{definition}
	Let $\mathcal{X}$ be a Hausdorff space. The lower semicontinuous envelope of $f: \mathcal{X}\rightarrow[-\infty, \infty]$ is 
	\[
	\overline{f}=\sup \left\lbrace g: \mathcal{X}\rightarrow[-\infty, \infty] \ |\quad  g\leq f \text{ and } g \text{ is lower semicontinuous}\right\rbrace.
	\]

%The locally convex topology defined
%by $\mathcal{P}$ on $X$ is called the weak topology or $Y-topology$ of X induced by the duality
%$(X,Y)$, and we denote it by $\sigma(X,Y)$. Similarly, the weak topology or X-topology
%of Y, denoted by $\sigma(Y, X)$, is the locally convex topology on Y generated by $Q$.
%Clearly, the roles of $X$ and $Y$ are interchangeable here, since there is a natural duality between $Y$ and $X$ which determines a dual system $(Y,X)$. Thus, it is sufficient to
%establish the properties only for the linear space $X$. According to the well-known re-sults concerning the locally convex topologies generated by families of seminorms,
%we immediately obtain the following result.
